# ARM Assembly (Mazidi) — Worked Exercises

This repository contains **original, student-friendly solutions** to exercises from  
*ARM Assembly Language Programming & Architecture* by **Muhammad Ali Mazidi**.  
It’s a public teaching resource and an academic contribution aimed at clarity, correctness, and reproducibility.

## What’s inside
- ✅ Semi step-by-step explanations (brief but instructive)
- ✅ Complete, runnable ARM/Thumb code snippets
- ✅ Page references to the Mazidi book (e.g., “See Mazidi, p. 87”)
- ✅ Per-chapter → per-section organization for easy study

## How to navigate
```
